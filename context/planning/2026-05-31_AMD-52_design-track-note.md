# AMD-52 Design Track — Typed `StateChangedEvent` Payload

**One-line status:** OQ-05-08 design beat DONE → Research 11 dispatched → AMD-52 authoring GATED (G1 serializer + G2 replay determinism OPEN).

This note is the lightweight successor to the **M4.0b-3 design-track map** (`2026-05-30_M4.0b-3_design-track-map.md`), which is **CLOSED** (its §0c FINAL — Workstream A complete, AMD-51 shipped `98f705b`). That map is the **predecessor**: it framed AMD-52's serializer/replay blast radius in its §3 and deferred it as OQ-05-08. **Do not reopen it.** This note carries the AMD-52 thread forward without duplicating the design beat.

## Where AMD-52 stands (HEAD `98f705b`, watermark AMD-51, `projectionVersion` 3)

- **AMD-51 shipped** the typed comparator and **preserved the String `StateChangedEvent` payload** on purpose (§2.7) so the typed-payload swap could be staged. AMD-52 is that swap.
- **The OQ-05-08 design beat is DONE:** `homesynapse-core-docs/design/2026-05-31_AMD-52_Typed_Payload_Serializer_Replay_Design_Beat.md`. It settled the four sub-questions from source:
  - **DECIDED** — no event-store / `view_checkpoints` row migration; typed payload stays in the `events.payload` BLOB; per-event `events.schema_version` is the string↔typed discriminator (beat §3).
  - **DECIDED** — AMD-52 is its own `projectionVersion` **3→4** bump riding AMD-50's frozen reconciliation-backfill unchanged (beat §5).
  - **DECIDED (mechanism)** — the nested `AttributeValue` codec is a custom Jackson (de)serializer in `core/persistence` keyed by an explicit `AttributeType` tag, **no `@JsonTypeInfo`** (ArchUnit Rule 7 + Jackson-isolation HARD RULE; beat §2.1).
  - **OPEN (forks → research)** — the exact tagged-union wire-form, deterministic `double` + `NaN`/`±Inf`/`−0.0` JSON encoding (beat §2.2), and the replay-determinism contract: Path A (re-derive typed from the immutable `state_reported` log during 3→4 backfill — authoritative, rides AMD-50/AMD-51 unchanged) vs Path B (version-branched decode of historical String payloads via the `AttributeValueUpcaster`) (beat §4).
- **Research 11 dispatched:** `context/instructions/Research_11_Typed_Event_Payload_Persistence_Brief.md` (REC-100+). Scoped ONLY to the OPEN forks; surveys Axon `@Revision`/upcaster chain, EventStoreDB, Akka Persistence serializers, Kafka Schema Registry union types.

## The path from here to AMD-52 (and the gate)

```

**Go/no-go (beat §9):** GO only when **G1 (serializer codec settled)** and **G2 (replay-determinism contract settled)** land; **G3 (CheckpointSerializer typed envelope)** and **G4 (consumer blast radius spec)** are authoring work once G1/G2 close; **G5 (row shape — no migration)** is already CLOSED. Until GO, the String `StateChangedEvent` payload stays **frozen** (AMD-51 §2.7).

## Frozen — do not reopen on this track
AMD-50 backfill mechanism (reused unchanged for 3→4); no `Clock` in `DerivationContext`; no `ServiceLoader`; D-01 (no exhaustive switch over event types — an exhaustive switch over the sealed `AttributeValue` IS allowed); the AMD-47 8-variant hierarchy; the `@JsonTypeInfo`-ban + Jackson-isolation rules; and — until AMD-52 ratifies — the String `StateChangedEvent` payload.

**Proposed implementing WU:** **M4.0b-4** (per the M4.0b-x / projection-block-50–52 scheme; AMD-50→51→**52**). Proposed, not locked — confirm with Nick.
