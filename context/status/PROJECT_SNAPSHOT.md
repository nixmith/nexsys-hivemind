# Project Snapshot

> **2026-07-02 (v14 hub, beat 48 — LAUNCHED; the deferred spine rotation EXECUTED — phantom-safe, file-tools-only; preflight STALE-benign → reconciled → re-run PASS, all 11 checks.)**
> Rotated: snapshot masthead beats 6–41 (27 entries) → `archive/PROJECT_SNAPSHOT-beats-06-41-rotated-2026-07-02.md`; the 2026-06-19/21-era Current-Work-Unit blocks (5) + the pre-beat-era Recent-Session-Log rows (30) → `archive/PROJECT_SNAPSHOT-work-unit-blocks-and-session-log-rotated-2026-07-02.md`; pm-handoff beats 5–43 (33 sections) → `archive/pm-handoff-beats-rotated-2026-07-02.md`.
> The v11-era Latest-commits / Last-updated / Current-state fields RETIRED to pointers (truth-hierarchy — they had drifted to AMD-95/170/50-era claims); retained beats converted to short-paragraph blocks (env-model §8). Live spine: snapshot ~38 KB (was 154.8) · pm-handoff ~25 KB (was 138.9).
> Check-8: the six ruled 06-27/28 Coder notes queued for below-separator archival at the M7.5c-a WUCP quiescent window (env-model §2b Coder-in-flight caution). pm-lessons +3 (two-grep absence rule · `add --dry-run` lock · keep-both-audit-layers). OR-GATE-M7.4 ledger-reconciled RESOLVED (beat-43 ci.yml subsumption). v13 prompt archived.
> Method: three write-disjoint agents under hub two-layer audit — one agent transcription defect self-caught pre-write, one hub post-return frontmatter correction; the redundancy is the mechanism.
> Fleet: core `2786526` · docs `1509b34` · hivemind `b9349e8`+beat-48 · bench `5ceff3b` · skills `90f8258`.
> **Next:** Nick commits beat-48 (hivemind only; HOST porcelain = 9 paths — the VM view lags pm-lessons.md per §2; message staged `_scratch/2026-07-02_hivemind_beat-48_commit-msg.txt`) → M7.5c-a → FE-1b on its landing → M9.1 on its WUCP close. Detail: pm-handoff beat-48 (pointer, not copy).**

> **2026-07-02 (v13 hub, beat 47 — the v13 CLOSE) — pre-commit audit standing (env-model §10, Nick's check institutionalized); `git add --dry-run` lock hazard + >30 min lag correction folded; v14 AUTHORED (first-act: the deferred rotation via a phantom-safe file-tools-only method — do not re-defer). Fleet: core `2786526` (FE-1 committed, 16 files audited-clean) · docs `1509b34` · hivemind `41a105d`+beat-47 · bench `5ceff3b` · skills `0825409`. M7.5c-a routes to the Coder NOW; M9.1 issue-ready (corrected); FE-1b awaits M7.5c-a; the website lane + install-smoke are the two unstarted mid-Aug surfaces. Detail: pm-handoff beat-47 (pointer, not copy).**

> **2026-07-02 (v13 hub, beat 46) — both lane returns AUDITED + ADJUDICATED (detail: pm-handoff beat-46 — pointer, not copy).
> Verdicts: M9-authoring = PASS-with-one-correction (WU-M9.1 §A31/B7 "no ConfigurationAccess impl" REFUTED — `ScopedConfigurationAccess` exists; correction folded into WU + instruction);
> FE-1 = PASS, two drifts adjudicated on the truth hierarchy with OPPOSITE rulings (DRIFT-1 bare `/internal/*` → Core conforms [M7.5c-a micro-WU, ISSUED, sequenced BEFORE M9.1]; DRIFT-2 URI problem-type → the freeze mis-transcribed Locked Doc 09 → v1.1.1 amendment FOLDED).
> Nick's four rulings: DP-A ratify-all (M9.1→M9.4 split + C/D/E/F) · DP-B deterministic identity policy · DRIFT-1 conform-first · DRIFT-2 amend-freeze.
> Coder sequence: M7.5c-a → M9.1 (corrected, issue-ready) → M9.2–M9.4 JIT from the return's charter. FE-1b after M7.5c-a lands.
> The FE lane's uncommitted `web-ui/dashboard/**` commits on this beat (message staged).
> core `52824e9`+FE-1-uncommitted · docs `1509b34` · hivemind `07f3065`+beats-46/lane-files · bench `5ceff3b` · skills `0825409`.**

> **2026-07-01 (v13 hub, beat 44) — skill-source precision pass: pointer-not-copy applied to BOTH skill mastheads; Check 9 → STALE pending Nick's mirror sync.**
> Nick's directive: audit ClaudeFolder (esp. the two skills) for precisely-articulated, token-economical instruction design. Method: an Explore-agent survey + hub direct verification of every load-bearing claim before editing.
> **Applied (hivemind skill sources):** (1) `project-manager/SKILL.md` masthead — the copied volatile state (HEADs/watermark/counts/"next slot," stale at AMD-95/170/50/`eed477e`) REPLACED by an explicit **state-pointer rule**
> ("this file carries no project state; re-derive at preflight; a state claim in a skill file is stale by construction") + the durable disciplines retained;
> (2) the PM Mode-3 §"Phase 3 vocabulary" 2026-06-19-era state narrative (cited the June-19 hub prompt as standing + W26 as current) REPLACED by durable vocabulary + a pointer paragraph;
> (3) `coder/SKILL.md` masthead — same restructure (durable build disciplines retained; state → pointer; the illustrative count cite de-fanged to `NN/NN/NN`);
> (4) `freshness-preflight.md` internal-consistency fix ("10-check superset"/"ten checks" strays → eleven);
> (5) `coder-handoff.md` frontmatter restamped (had frozen at 2026-05-27/M3.7 while the body ran to AB-4; now points at the newest entry + spine as authoritative).
> **Verified-refuted (no edit):** the survey agent's "CLAUDE.md says 19-module but actual is 22" claim is FALSE — exactly 19 `module-info.java` main source sets exist; CLAUDE.md is correct (trust-but-verify catches subagents too).
> **Verification:** both mastheads grep-clean of state tokens; preflight strays 0; no NUL/encoding damage (the VM "binary" flag was a long-line grep heuristic).
> **Logged, deferred:** the mega-line/token-economy overhaul (~440 lines >600 chars across the hot path, worst = coder-lessons; fold into the phantom-gated beat-block rotation, converting snapshot beats to short-paragraph entries per env-model §8);
> a coder/references content-refresh pass post-M9 (dates old, content verified functionally coherent by survey — restamp only with a real content pass).
> **Check 9 is STALE by design** — Nick runs the external mirror sync (preferably BEFORE launching the two lanes so they load the clean skills; not blocking — both lane prompts pin baselines + mandate the preflight, which overrides any stale skill masthead).
> **Next:** Nick: beat-44 commit → mirror sync → launch the two lanes (unchanged from beat 43). core `52824e9` · docs `1509b34` · hivemind `45de9b5`+beat-44 · bench `5ceff3b` · skills `846fe56`.

> **2026-07-01 (v13 hub, beat 43) — the beats-41/42 fleet is COMMITTED + PUSHED (all five repos); ci.yml VERIFIED GREEN on core HEAD; the two parallel lanes are AUTHORED and launch-ready.**
> Nick ran the full host-side package: docs **`1509b34`** (AMD-96 + AMD-97 + INV-ES-09 — the governance fold, 7 files) · hivemind **`cea7ae1`** (carries beats 41 AND 42 — the message says "beat 41"; cosmetic)
> · core **`52824e9`** (the frontend.yml source-copy sync) · skills **`846fe56`** (the nexsys-frontend carry — the v12 residual CLOSED) · bench holds `5ceff3b`.
> **Bench `git status` clean in Nick's terminal — the phantom diagnosis is CONFIRMED** (the VM's mass-deletion view was a truncated read of `.git/index`; nothing was ever wrong host-side).
> **Gate of record: `ci.yml` GREEN on `52824e9`** (screenshot-verified: Build & Check 3m5s, Gradle 8.8, `check` ✅) — this subsumes the OR-GATE per-commit residual for the whole ancestor chain (AB-4/M7.5a/b/frontend).
> **`frontend.yml` note:** its path filter is `web-ui/dashboard/**`, so `dbb0109` (which touched only `.github/workflows/`) could never have triggered it — **`52824e9` is its FIRST triggering push**; Nick's Actions glance on that run is the one open gate item.
> **Dependabot re-surfaced at push: 5 (1 critical, 1 high, 3 moderate)** — the Security-tab shipped-vs-dev triage stays open (beat-33 decision tree; Jetty-via-Javalin prime suspect).
> **New CI-housekeeping residual (logged):** the Actions annotation — checkout@v4 / setup-java@v4 / setup-gradle@v4 target deprecated Node 20; bump the action majors at a convenient window (non-blocking).
> **Lanes authored (launch after the beat-43 commit):** `context/handoff/2026-07-01_M9-authoring-lane_session_prompt.md` (write-isolated M9 instruction authoring against corpus 5ceff3b + AMD-97 at docs 1509b34 + the seven acceptance additions; returns to the hub for audit)
> + `context/handoff/2026-07-01_frontend-live-integration_FE-1_session_prompt.md` (FE-1 per FE1_GO_LIVE.md + the four E5 rendering semantics as one-click scenarios; M9-independent; needs Nick for the Core boot + token).
> **Next:** Nick commits beat-43 (hivemind) → launches both lanes as fresh Cowork conversations → returns route here. core `52824e9` · docs `1509b34` · hivemind `cea7ae1`+beat-43 · bench `5ceff3b` · skills `846fe56`.

> **2026-07-01 (v13 hub, beat 42) — THE GOVERNANCE QUEUE IS RATIFIED + FOLDED (Nick's four rulings): AMD-96 + AMD-97 RATIFIED, INV-ES-09 registered — watermark AMD-95→97, invariants 170→172/51. M9 IS UNBLOCKED.**
> Nick ruled via the v13 decision pass: (1) **AMD-96 consolidate+ratify** — folded with the CAND-2/3 verbatim diffs as §2.A/§2.B (Kelvin-at-ingestion CT row + 0x010D note + §3.10 light-row color de-invite + §3.6 non-precluding note; all BEFORE anchors confirmed verbatim)
> + the bench §3.3 currency (measured baseline 7.4.5.0/v13; v14/ASH batch contingency; VID:PID port-id rule, never descriptor strings; version-at-stack-init) + the NEW Doc 08 §3.7 OccupancySensing row;
> (2) **AMD-97 ratified with full fold** — Doc 08 §3.6 `confirmation[]` (8 fields stated; enum `degradeRule`; the E5 taxonomy split carried by `confirmability × reportsAuthoritative`; measured Wave-1 worked example + corpus pointer; 4 engine-consumption caveats)
> + Doc 02 §3.8 confirmability override + **AMD-97-INV-01 (never-false-CONFIRMED, §51)** + the Doc 16 §4 V1-wire-subset recording note;
> (3) **D2 → INV-ES-09** (§2), watermark-neutral, FSM+per-subscriber-guard text, AIOT-INV-1 citation fixed in both register locations;
> (4) **next = M9 authoring + FE-1 live-integration lane in parallel.**
> **Verification: every edit grep-confirmed; the invariant total re-derived from the §17 table = 172 exactly; nav-index currency-fixed (its watermark line had trailed at AMD-87).**
> The three hivemind governance files closed (RATIFIED/APPLIED status lines). Docs-repo commit PREPARED for Nick (`_scratch/2026-07-01_host-side_commands.md`, updated — docs commit added; all commits host-side, phantom active).
> **Next Core slot: author M9** against the measured corpus + AMD-97 + the beat-41 acceptance additions (fresh-context session recommended; grounding-subagent-before-authoring).
> **Frontend: launch FE-1 live-integration** (M9-independent; route the E5 rendering semantics). docs `75d0345`+AMD-96/97-fold-uncommitted · core `dbb0109` · hivemind `89da546`+beats-41/42 · bench `5ceff3b` · skills `5bc78bc`+carry.

**Last updated:** RETIRED as a field (v14 hub, 2026-07-02) — the NEWEST masthead beat above is the authoritative last-updated record (truth-hierarchy: never trust a copied stamp; the v11-era narrative this field carried is in git history, pre-rotation blob).

**Current state:** POINTER, not copy (v14 hub, 2026-07-02) — re-derive from the NEWEST masthead beat above + the backlog's newest currency note + `git log` per repo. This field carried a v11-era narrative that had drifted against the ratified state (AMD-95/170/50 vs the actual AMD-97/172/51; "AB-4 uncommitted" vs long-committed); retired per the truth-hierarchy discipline, prior text in git history. Durable frame only: the Core engine ACTS, CONFIRMS, EXPLAINS (both hero halves on the live log), and ENCRYPTS-AT-REST from genesis; the dashboard is live-integrated; the moat is measured (bench) and ratified (AMD-97). Phase 3 — test-first implementation.
**Open flags:** See **`## Open Risks`** below for the live list. **Standing deferred:** OR-M13-SDNOTIFY (sd_notify AF_UNIX-datagram transport -> M13; JDK-21 has no AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM; seam-tested; M5-D decision matrix authored). **No open deferred build gates** (M7.2b GREEN, zero gate-fix rounds). **Check 9 PASS as of 2026-07-02** (both mirrors verified byte-identical at the v14 launch preflight; goes STALE again after any skill-source edit until Nick's next mirror sync). The M6-era open-flags ledger (AMD-66..71 / OR-M6-NONCE / OR-PD-07-AMD, all RESOLVED) rotated -> the 2026-06-22 archive.
**Hardware (standing):** **Wave 1 ✅ RECEIVED 2026-06-23** — MG24/EZSP + Philips Hue RGBW 2-pack + 2× SNZB-03P motion + USB extension = the FULL hero set (the MG24/EZSP runs motion→light on its own). **Wave 2 (ZBDongle-P/ZNP second path + device breadth) ORDERED, not yet received.** **Meantime strategy = FRONT-LOAD the bench** (the highest-leverage parallel track now): characterize on the EZSP path via a reference stack (no M9 code) → device corpus + durable TEST FIXTURES (M9 acceptance + M7.4 E2E) → Doc 02/08 MATCH/GAP verdicts → harden the repeatable device-onboarding pipeline so Wave 2 + every future device flow through it seamlessly. See `context/planning/2026-06-22_hardware-bench-bringup-and-device-characterization_brief.md` + the v6 prompt §8.E + the fan-out Session C.
**M4 retrospective:** `context/audits/2026-06-05_M4-retrospective.md` (sizing, the instruction-scope-miss pattern + the consumer/pin survey fix, deferred-gate shift-left, the partial-closeout finding, the debt register, strategic/velocity, and the keep-doing list). For M4 execution history see the Recent Session Log below.
**Latest commits:** RETIRED as a field (v14 hub, 2026-07-02) — re-derive fleet state from the NEWEST masthead beat above + `git log` per repo (truth-hierarchy: never trust a copied HEAD). The v11-era narrative this field carried is preserved in `archive/PROJECT_SNAPSHOT-beats-06-41-rotated-2026-07-02.md`.
**Current phase:** P3 — Implementation (test-first).
**Days remaining:** ~151 (to Nov 25, 2026)
**Launch target:** November 25, 2026 · **Mid-August go/no-go ≈ week 8** (the 4 gates: engine LIVE / hero on real data / hardware validating / install proven)

## Interface Specifications (Phase 2 — FROZEN)

Phase 2 completed 2026-03-20 with all 16 JPMS-compiled subsystem modules specified (plus 3 scaffold modules — platform-systemd, test-support, dashboard — that have MODULE_CONTEXT.md placeholders but no compiled Java yet). See `context/planning/phase-2-block-backlog.md` for the frozen historical record of Blocks A–S. Summary at Phase 2 close: 16 modules specified, ~402 production Java files, all module-info.java files compile clean with `-Xlint:all -Werror`. AMD-33 subsequently (2026-04-10) ratified DomainEvent as permanently non-sealed.

## Code State

- **Repository:** homesynapse-core, **22 Gradle subprojects** (per `settings.gradle.kts`; source-verified 2026-06-13): ~16–17 JPMS-compiled production modules + 3 scaffold-only (platform-systemd, test-support, web-ui:dashboard) + `testing/integration-tests` (on-device ITs, classpath-only test code) + `spike:wal-validation` (throwaway spike — standing `git rm` advisory).
- **Production + test Java files:** **~803** (573 main + 230 test; +41 testFixtures ≈ 844) (source-verified 2026-06-13; supersedes the 724 count from 2026-05-28 — growth from M4.B/M4.C/M5-A/M6.1/M6.2/M6.4). Across the JPMS-compiled production modules (post-M3.6e.2 addition of `MaterializedStateQueryService`, `ReadinessFilter`, `RestFilters` in state-store/rest-api, plus `DeploymentProfile` thread-pool fields, `HomeSynapseCore` Javalin bootstrap wiring, `StateQueryService.materialized()` static factory). Test files: **~2,002 @Test/@ParameterizedTest/@RepeatedTest methods** (source-verified 2026-06-13; supersedes the 1,422 count from 2026-05-28) across ~173 test files and ~35+ testFixtures files (M3.6e.1 added: `MaterializedStateQueryServiceTest` (10 tests), `ReadinessFilterTest` (8 tests), `DeploymentProfileTest` (4 tests), `HomeSynapseCoreTest` stateQueryService test, `StateQueryServiceTest` updated assertion).
- **Event-bus module (post-M3.6d-a):** 19 public + 14 package-private = 33 top-level types. M3.6d-a promoted `QueueSaturationHealthCheck`, `HealthSignal`, `HealthLevel` to public (DEC-M3-17 — transitive 3-type chain because the public constructor's `Consumer<HealthSignal>` parameter would have triggered `-Xlint:exports` otherwise). M3.6b added `EventBusConfig` (public record, 2 fields: `replayQueueCapacity`, `publisherBlockedDepthThreshold`; `HOME_DEFAULT` constant). `InProcessEventBus` promoted to `public` (DEC-M3-16); new canonical 7-arg constructor accepting `EventBusConfig`. `PUBLISHER_BLOCKED_DEPTH_THRESHOLD` replaced by instance field from config. `ReplayWindowQueue` capacity parameterized (default 10,000 via no-arg; custom via `ReplayWindowQueue(int)`). `InProcessEventBusFactory` gained `createWithConfig(...)`. `EventBus` interface has 8 methods (4 abstract Phase 2, 4 default M3.1). `BusMetrics` interface (7 canonical metric names) with `BusMetricsJfr` JFR-native implementation.
- **Persistence module (post-M3.6d-b):** 48 types (was 45). M3.6d-b added `PersistenceFactory` (public final class — static `start()` factory, 8 store/infrastructure accessors returning public interface types, `AutoCloseable`), `SqliteSubscriberReadConnectionFactory` (package-private — production impl of `SubscriberReadConnectionFactory`, creates per-subscriber dedicated platform-thread executor + SQLite read connection; INV-SUB-ISO-02), `SqliteSubscriberReadExecutor` (package-private — per-subscriber read executor backed by a single platform thread and dedicated `Connection`; close() shuts down executor and connection). `WriteCoordinator` interface gained `int queueSize()` (DEC-M3-14); `PlatformThreadWriteCoordinator` implements it by exposing the bounded executor's queue size. `SqlitePersistenceLifecycle` expanded from 4-store to 6-store construction: now also constructs `SqliteStateStore` + `SqliteDeadLetterStore` during `start()`, with a separate `Include.ALWAYS`-configured `ObjectMapper` for `CheckpointSerializer` (distinct from the `NON_NULL` `PersistenceObjectMapper.create()` used for event payloads). New accessors: `stateStore()`, `deadLetterStore()`, `subscriberReadConnectionFactory()`. Module-info gained no new directives (all dependencies already present from M3.6d-a). `SqliteStateStore` now `implements StateCheckpointSource` (method renamed `serialize(int)` → `serializeCheckpoint(int)`, both `serializeCheckpoint` and `loadedProjectionVersion()` promoted to public via interface; class itself remains package-private — only the two interface methods are externally visible). M3.5b added `SqliteStateStore` (ConcurrentHashMap-backed materialized view + checkpoint-driven recovery), `SqliteDeadLetterStore` (UPSERT on (subscriber_id, event_position)), `CheckpointSerializer`, `CheckpointData`, `AtomicCheckpointWriter.writeAtomicCheckpointWithDlqPark()` (three-way atomic write — subscriber checkpoint + view checkpoint + DLQ park), V004 DLQ operational indices migration. Two ObjectMapper configurations coexist: `PersistenceObjectMapper.create()` returns `NON_NULL` for event payloads; checkpoint serialization requires `ALWAYS` and is constructed at composition time (composition-root wiring lands in M3.6d-b).
- **State-store module (post-M3.6e.1):** 20 public + 2 package-private types (M3.6e.1 added `MaterializedStateQueryService` — package-private final, backed by `StateStore`, recomputes stale at read time via injected `Clock`; `StateQueryService.materialized(StateStore, ReadinessSource, Clock, LongSupplier)` public static factory exposes construction surface per DEC-M3-16 pattern). `ReadinessSource` public interface (single method `mode() → SubscriberMode`). Projection-checkpoint wiring's `StateCheckpointSource` interface in scope. Advisory 10 MB checkpoint-size guardrail enforced.
- **Lifecycle module (post-M3.6e.2):** 8 public + 2 package-private types. M3.6e.2 expanded `HomeSynapseCore`: bootstrap sequence now 16 steps (14 from M3.6e.1 + 2 from M3.6e.2: entity query endpoint registration via `RestFilters.addEntityEndpoints` + admin endpoint registration via `RestFilters.installAdminEndpoints`). M3.6e.1 added steps 11-12 (added step 11: `MaterializedStateQueryService` wiring via `StateQueryService.materialized(stateStore, this, clock, () -> stateProjection.cursorPosition())`, step 12: Javalin server construction with `QueuedThreadPool(profile.javalinMaxThreads(), profile.javalinMinThreads())` + `RestFilters.installReadinessGate(app, this)` + `app.start(7070)`). `stateQueryService()` now returns the real `MaterializedStateQueryService` (replaces `ThrowingStateQueryService` placeholder). Module-info gained `requires com.homesynapse.api.rest`, `requires io.javalin`, `requires org.eclipse.jetty.util`. `DeploymentProfile` gained `javalinMinThreads()`/`javalinMaxThreads()` accessors for Javalin thread pool sizing: STUDIO(1/4), HOME(2/8), PERFORMANCE(4/16).
- **testing/integration-tests module (M3.4a + M3.4b):** Module #20. Tests gated on `-PpiProfile` (off by default; excluded from `./gradlew check`). Five IT tests: `BurstLoadIT`, `HeapBudgetIT` (M3.4a), `Pi4SustainedLoadIT`, `Pi4D1SpikeIT`, `CrashRecoveryIT` (M3.4b). `IntegrationTestHarness` composes `PersistenceTestHarness` + `InProcessEventBusFactory` against a real `@TempDir` SQLite file, with `startThrottled()` and `startForCrashSimulation()` factories (M3.4b). JVM constraints: `-Xmx256m -Xms256m -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=4 -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100`.
- **MODULE_CONTEXT.md:** 20 files exist total — 17 populated substantively (including `testing/integration-tests` populated during WUCP Phase 2 reconciliation), 3 stubs (platform-systemd, dashboard, test-support). `core/event-bus/MODULE_CONTEXT.md` updated in M3.6b (EventBusConfig, InProcessEventBus public + 7-arg constructor, ReplayWindowQueue parameterized, InProcessEventBusFactory.createWithConfig). `core/persistence/MODULE_CONTEXT.md` updated in M3.6a (DeploymentProfile 3→6 fields, DatabaseExecutor accepts profile, LockingMode enum, PersistenceLifecycle Javadoc cleaned). `core/state-store/MODULE_CONTEXT.md` updated in projection-checkpoint wiring (added `StateCheckpointSource`, byte[0] stub deprecation note, projectionVersion authoritative source).
- **Rest-api module (post-M3.6e.2):** 28 Phase 2 public types + 2 M3.6e.1 types + 8 M3.6e.2 package-private types = 38 Java files. M3.6e.2 added `EndpointContext` (package-private SPI interface), `JavalinEndpointContext` (adapter), `EndpointResponses` (utility), `ListEntitiesEndpoint`, `GetEntityEndpoint`, `GetEntityStateEndpoint`, `DlqStatusEndpoint`, `ProjectionStatusEndpoint` (all package-private endpoint handlers). `RestFilters` gained 2 new public methods (`addEntityEndpoints`, `installAdminEndpoints`). M3.6e.1 added `ReadinessFilter` (package-private — implements `io.javalin.http.Handler`, 503 rejection with RFC 9457 problem detail body + `X-HomeSynapse-Projection-State` + `Retry-After: 5` headers) and `RestFilters` (public final utility — `installReadinessGate(Object javalinApp, ReadinessSource)` with deliberate `Object` typing to erase Javalin from the public API surface per DEC-M3-16). Module-info gained `requires transitive com.homesynapse.state`, `requires com.homesynapse.event.bus`, `requires io.javalin`, `requires org.slf4j`. Build.gradle.kts: `implementation` → `api` for state-store (fixes JPMS scope mismatch — websocket-api `requires transitive com.homesynapse.api.rest` needs state-store transitively visible). `ProblemType` enum gained `STATE_STORE_REPLAYING` (D-7).
- **Tests:** **~2,002** @Test methods total (source-verified 2026-06-13; supersedes 1,422 from 2026-05-28). Contract test suites: `EventStoreContractTest` (27), `EventBusContractTest` (50), `WriteCoordinatorContractTest` (11), `CheckpointStoreContractTest` (9), `ViewCheckpointStoreContractTest` (10), `DeadLetterStoreContractTest` (10). M3.6e.1 added `MaterializedStateQueryServiceTest` (10 — 4 staleness-recomputation, 3 snapshot variants, 1 unmodifiable-map, 1 view-position, 1 isReady-delegation), `ReadinessFilterTest` (8 — LIVE pass-through, 3 non-LIVE 503 with diagnostic headers, RFC 9457 body shape, mode-freshness), `DeploymentProfileTest` (4 — all 3 profiles + min≤max invariant), `StateQueryServiceTest` assertion updated to 6 methods (D-3 static factory). M3.6d-a added `ReconciliationTest` (4 of 5 methods — OR-M3-13) + `SharedSchedulerTest` (5). Prior: M3.5b added `AtomicCheckpointWriterDlqTest` (3), `CheckpointSerializerTest` (12+), `SqliteStateStoreTest` (12). Supervisor DLQ wiring added `SubscriberSupervisorTest` (12). M3.4a added `BurstLoadIT` + `HeapBudgetIT` (gated). M3.4b added `ThrottledWriteCoordinatorTest` (9) + `Pi4SustainedLoadIT` + `Pi4D1SpikeIT` + `CrashRecoveryIT` (gated).
- **Traceability:** 01-event-model.md (44 entries), 12-lifecycle.md (2 entries). Stub indexes remain for docs 02–11, 13, 14 — Phase 2 traceability debt carries into Phase 3.
- **Last build gate:** RESOLVED. Full `./gradlew check` GREEN (139 tasks) at HEAD `98f705b` on 2026-05-30 (M4.0b-3, AMD-51 typed comparator + `projectionVersion` 2→3; `:core:device-model:check` + `:core:state-store:check` + `:lifecycle:lifecycle:check` GREEN). Build confirmed by Nick. The `:testing:integration-tests:test -PpiProfile=throttled` run was not held to completion — `Pi4D1SpikeIT` is a fixed 30-min soak (not a hang), excluded from the default `check`, and AMD-51 does not touch the path it exercises; not a blocker. **No deferred build gates open.** Prior: `60b4185` M4.B3, `7610296` M4.0b-2 — both GREEN.

## Active Work

- **Last completed:** M3.6e.2 via Claude Code (2026-05-22, `76288af`). M3.6 COMPLETE — all seven sub-WUs shipped. Seventeen CC WUs total.
- **Next:** M3.7 scoping via research pipeline. E2E integration tests. Estimated Coder time: 6–8h.
- **Claude Code workflow validated:** acceptEdits mode, Opus 4.7 xhigh, deny git commit/push/gradlew. PM generates task instruction → Claude Code executes → Nick reviews git diff, runs build gate, commits. Through M3.6e.2, seventeen Claude Code WUs executed via this workflow. Bus-Fix Piece A and SLF4J follow-up patch were direct edits by Nick.

## Blocking Issues

None. No unresolved deferred build gates. All M3.6a through M3.6e.1 build gates GREEN at commit time.

## Open Risks

- **OR-M3-17 — FULLY CLOSED (M4.0b-1, 2026-05-29, `cf1a97e`).** The no-op `MINIMAL_DERIVATION_RULE` lambda (the M3.7 placeholder that closed the *symptom*) is now replaced by the production `ProductionDerivationRule` (package-private in `com.homesynapse.state`, reached via `DerivationRule.production()`), which publishes a real `state_changed` on a canonical-attribute change. Real derivation has shipped per DEC-M3-10 + REC-28.
- **OR-M3-18 — FULLY CLOSED (M4.0b-1, 2026-05-29, `cf1a97e`).** The `MinimalProjectionAdvancer` placeholder is removed and replaced by `DispatchingProjectionAdvancer` (REC-28 — package-private, constructor-injected `EnvelopeHandler` map, no `ServiceLoader`, forward-all with exact cursor parity). The advancer class file was deleted from `lifecycle`.
- **OR-M3-12 — DEC-M3-17 governance entry (NEW 2026-05-20):** RESOLVED in this WUCP Phase 2 closeout. HealthSignal + HealthLevel public promotion alongside QueueSaturationHealthCheck logged as DEC-M3-17; entries appended to Current_State §3 ledger, Locked_Decisions Phase 3 milestone section, and `context/decisions/phase-3-cross-module-decisions.md`. No further action.
- **OR-M3-13 — ReconciliationRecordsMetadataInDataSlot — RESOLVED (M4.0a, 2026-05-29, `a441fdf`).** Reconciliation metadata (`reconciledAt`/`reconciledFromVersion`/`reconciledToVersion`) is now populated via the extended `StateCheckpointSource.serializeCheckpoint(...)` surface, threaded through `StateProjection.initialize()`'s version-mismatch reconciliation branch; `SqliteStateStore` writes the values instead of `null`. `ReconciliationTest`'s deferred 5th method (`reconciliationRecordsMetadataInDataSlot`) is un-deferred and passing — it asserts `reconciledToVersion == 2`, the value M4.0b's backfill gate binds to. AMD-41 §3.2.4's metadata-recording requirement is now met.
- **OR-M3-14 — M3.6d-b prerequisite infrastructure (NEW 2026-05-20):** RESOLVED 2026-05-21. All three prerequisite pieces shipped in the M3.6d-b 4-commit cohort: (1) `WriteCoordinator.queueSize()` at `a33ee40`; (2) production `SqliteSubscriberReadConnectionFactory` at `a59b64e`; (3) `SqlitePersistenceLifecycle` 6-store expansion + `PersistenceFactory` public gateway at `725353d`. `HomeSynapseCore` composition root completed at `dfb045e`. Build GREEN.

## Tracked Gaps (carry forward)

1. **Tier 9 `reconciliationOnVersionMismatch` test still `@Disabled("M3.5a")`** — re-enablement was split out of Bus-Fix Piece A. Now tracked under M3.6 lifecycle wiring (depends on `bus.resume()` VT re-spawn fix).
2. **`bus.resume()` does not re-spawn VT** — pre-existing M3.1 limitation; deferred to M3.6 lifecycle wiring.
3. **Overflow test slow (~5-15s)** — consider `@Tag("slow")` if suite time grows.
4. **JFR-native emission is accepted design debt** — pull-based metrics consumer (Prometheus/OTLP) will need typed adapter layer in M4+.
5. **Publish-latency metric is bus-side only** — end-to-end publish latency is a persistence-module metric for future observability pass.
6. **`lagEvents` approximation** — uses `pendingPositions.size()` instead of writer-tail-minus-delivered-position. To be revisited under M3.4b Pi4SustainedLoadIT if accuracy proves insufficient.
7. ~~**Composition root for ALWAYS-configured ObjectMapper**~~ — **CLOSED (M3.6d-b `725353d`).** `SqlitePersistenceLifecycle.start()` now constructs a separate `ALWAYS`-configured `ObjectMapper` for `CheckpointSerializer`, distinct from `PersistenceObjectMapper.create()` (`NON_NULL`). Wired through `PersistenceFactory`.
8. ~~**`QueueSaturationHealthCheck` and `DerivedWriteRateLimit` lifecycle wiring deferred**~~ — **CLOSED (M3.6d-b `dfb045e`).** `HomeSynapseCore.start()` constructs both and passes them to `SharedScheduler`.
9. ~~**`DerivedWriteRateLimit.refill()` externally called**~~ — **CLOSED (M3.6d-b `dfb045e`).** `SharedScheduler` calls `refill()` every 50 ms via `safelyInvoke(rateLimit::refill)`.
10. ~~**Defence-in-depth `IllegalStateException` for `EventPublisher.publish()` from REPLAY**~~ — **CLOSED (M3.6d-b `dfb045e`).** `HomeSynapseCore` subscribes the projection with `SubscriptionFilter.all()` + `coalesceExempt=true`; the bus's mode FSM prevents publish calls during REPLAY. The composition root wiring itself is the defence.
11. **Post-shutdown defensive handling in stores** — `SqliteDeadLetterStore` (and siblings) will throw uncaught exceptions if methods are called after `DatabaseExecutor.shutdown()`. Pre-existing pattern, not an M3.5b regression. Track for a future hardening pass.
12. ~~**`AtomicCheckpointWriter` code duplication**~~ — **CLOSED (M4.0a / H2, `a441fdf`).** Shared `executeInTransaction(context, work)` helper extracted; both `writeAtomicCheckpoint` and `writeAtomicCheckpointWithDlqPark` route through it.

## Schedule Position

**Significantly ahead of Master Release Plan.** The 37-week plan placed Weeks 1–10 as "Interface Specification" — the project finished that work in 7 days (Mar 14–20). Phase 3 persistence subsystem (M2.x) complete. Event bus production implementation with full REPLAY→LIVE algorithm + backpressure + persistent DLQ + state projection + integration tests (including sustained-load and crash-recovery) all landed in the M3.1–M3.4b window (May 16–19). See the Phase 3 Progress Annotation in `master-release-plan.md` for actual vs planned dates.

## Next on Critical Path

1. **M4 next-part scope/plan** (fresh Cowork conversation) — formally define the scope of the next M4 segment: **Workstream B** device-model breadth (AMD-44 Floor/EntityRole impl, Research 8 REC-23–30) and **Workstream C** integration-api interface freeze (Research 6 REC-41–51, P3-gated on Nick's NQ-1..6), plus the **AMD-52** typed-`StateChangedEvent` serializer/replay design beat (OQ-05-08). Surface deep-research needs (e.g. Axon and other event-sourced platforms) to de-risk scale/maintainability — grounded in concrete forward design questions, not invented problems.
2. ~~**AMD-51 §2.6 erratum**~~ — **DONE 2026-05-31** (docs repo). The missing-schema → `StringValue` string-compare fallback (M4.0b-3 D-1) is recorded as the ratified no-schema behaviour in AMD-51 §2.6; the amendment now matches shipped code. (Commit pending with the docs-repo warm-up batch.) Also DONE: the KB doc-currency punch-list (0a-ii) — `HomeSynapse_Current_State`/`Knowledge_Primer`/`Navigation_Index`/`Decisions_Quick_Reference` brought current to `98f705b`/`projectionVersion` 3/watermark AMD-51.
3. **Phase 2 traceability debt** — 10 stub indexes remain (docs 02–11, 13, 14); state-store/device-model M4.0b-3 entries also pending. Low priority; batch later.
